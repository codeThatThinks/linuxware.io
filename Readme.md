# linuxware.io

A Rails application that tracks software and their respective packages across Linux distributions. It fetches package lists and links packages to software. A piece of software can be looked up and linuxware will get a list of the packages for it that are available on various distros.

Currently in alpha. Will soon be available at [linuxware.io](http://linuxware.io).

## Contributing

There are still many core features to be implemented. Current code must be refactored to improve performace so that it is capable of running on a VPS with limited resources.
